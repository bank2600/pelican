Summary: Update 

Someone told me that while doing freebsd-update they had the option for 10.3. I have not tried this yet to confirm or deny. Also a OpenBSD 5.9 was released. I ordered the cdrom to support the project a while ago. It has not came in the mail yet. Undeadly has more details on it [here](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20160329181346&mode=expanded).  As of writing this on 3/31/2016 my OpenBSD uptime on 5.8 is, 12:31PM  up 127 days, 15:57, 1 user, load averages: 0.51, 0.48, 0.51.
