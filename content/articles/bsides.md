Summary: Wild ride through the hills.

It took a bit to find some parking. Once parking was aquired everything went off without a hitch. The coolest talk I seen was about ransomware. The most exciting thing was him showing us the trail the hackers had left, also the tools they built to track/graph them. He also spoke of firewall rules to deny domains that where very new. I have never thought about that angle. His talk got the most questions from the audience. 

The most diffrent talk was about Minecraft and threat modeling. Having played Minecraft I had some assumptions. I Learned a lot about minecraft that I was not aware of. There was a young boy that was a minecraft expert. Seeing this is the crowd really confirmed what the whole talk was about. The toys that the kids have now days are freaking amazing.

Recently I have got some books on C and assembly. I have not started working from them yet. Guess I should study for the security+? I wonder if there is diffrent options.
