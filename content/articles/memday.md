Summary: Catching up on three day weekend.

Over this long weekend I have managed to update my FreeNAS from 9.3 stable into 9.19 stable. First pFsense got off that old branch now the folks over at iXsystems are doing it also. I've been excited about this coming for a while. I've also got the Arduino out with some new porjects in mind. National Geographic has had nice programs about the Iraq and Vietnam War on all day. For some strange reason my Arduino only works in USB3 ports. I'll look into this later. I've figured out how
to compile and upload code into the unit.For some strange reason my Arduino only works in USB3 ports. I'll look into this later. I've figured out how to compile and upload code into the unit.

The second lab is complete [here](http://ardx.org/src/circ/CIRC02-code.txt) is the code that came with it. All this code is public. As always all my projects are on my Github. Nice this next lab looks like it has a electric motor included. I've got some of this on my mind for small gifts for family and friends! Today I got the first five circuit labs done.
