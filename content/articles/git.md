I could not figure out why a specific directory was not getting pushed to git. Turns out in the directory I had a .git folder because it was the root of a former repository. I was unable to use git at all for that project. Someone else had the same exact problem and I found the solution [here](https://superuser.com/questions/837668/fatal-index-file-corrupt-keeps-repeating-in-git). The more I use Git the better I get. =)
