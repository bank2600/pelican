Summary: 8 bit Ham Radio with Arduino HamShield.

#Preface

Yesterday when I got home from work I found a small package from Enchanced Radio Devices on the doorstep. It was [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/749835103/hamshield-for-arduino-vhf-uhf-transceiver) glorious little device. I got the UNO clone along with the kit so I can keep this as one unit and keep other Arduino for my other labs. In my prepracel anxiety I have started taking the pratice tests for the amature radio liscense tests.
