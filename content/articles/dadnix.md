Summary: Repleaced Windows XP with GNU/Linux

Took the old Asus EEEpc and removed Windows Xp and installed [Elementry OS](https://elementary.io/). He just started using it with no instruction.
Great way to bring back old hardware to life. I have previously ran NetBSD on a EEEpc with a slim kernel and it worked great.
All I have left to do for his install. Is setup the Printer and automatic updates.
