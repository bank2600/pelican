Well I have officially ordered a case for my KVM VGA passthrough linux gaming experiment. Not sure if I'll run Arch or Fedora for this. I did not check the card clearance of the case I got, hope it does not bite me down the road. I have got bit by Arch in the past from a kernelbug and the snapper snapshot program developed by OpenSuse (it has since been fixed around 3.14 I think). 

Just read tonight that [4.2 is out!](https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/8/30/96 "4.2"), think it's Arch. 

**More on the specs later**

Eventually I looked into doing this on my newer machine. To try and avoid using other disks for running Windows. Even on my more recent motherboard it's not possible. Both motherboards did not support iommu grouping. After researching and banging my head on the keyboard I finally emailed MSI. They confirmed what I did not want to believe. I could never get the VM to post or display anything on a second monitor. I've sense reinstalled another operating system on my
workstation so I can't provide any logs.
