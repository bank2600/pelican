Well I have officaly orderd a case for my KVM VGA passthrough linux gaming experiment. Not sure if I'll run Arch or Fedora for this. I did not check the card clearnace of the case I got, hope it does not bite me down the road. I have got bit by Arch in the past from a kernelbug and the snapper snapshot program developed by OpenSuse (it has since been fixed around 3.14 I think). 

Just read tonight that [4.2 is out!](https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/8/30/96 "4.2"), think it's Arch. 

**More on the specs later**
