Summary: OpwnWrt on cheap router

Very impressed with how easy to install and stable OpenWRT has been
so far. I have not pushed much data through it yet but the install was painles 
and quick. I expected to have to setup the router first in terminal. I say this
only because when I googled OpenWRT I never seen any screenshots. This could
be seen as intimidating for some users I'd think. Heck I have not even logged
into the router via SSH yet but I did turn it on. I like the way the menues are
setup very simple and clean. I'm not sure if there is a package manager like 
pFsense. I bought two of thests WD Mynet N600 on sale for $9.99 on [http://www.woot.com](woot). Very cool how they always show drink mixes on the terminal
after you login. I'm not a drinker but I like the ascii art. On some of my systems I like piping fortune into the login. Takes me back to [http://www.slackware.com](Slackware).
