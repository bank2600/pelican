Summary: I broke my FreeNAS

Just tried changing the train from 9.3 Stable to 9.10 stable. Everything seemed to break I could not login to the Webgui at all. It was cool to have the option in Grub to revert to a snapshot. Now I have all my services back up and running. So glad I did not have to do a reinstall. I will read more about the upgrade and see if there are some steps that I'm missing. Recently I tried installing [PCBSD](https://www.pcbsd.org/) on my laptop but the wireless did not work.
