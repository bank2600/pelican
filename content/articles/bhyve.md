Summary: Native BSD hypervisor!

With the release of FreeNAS 11 it's now possible to run other operating systems without using the linuxemulation layer. I'll make a list below of some things I observed. 

`
1. Windows10   - Needed to use updated virtio drivers from [RedHat](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Windows_Virtio_Drivers)
2. Server 2012 - *same as above.
3. CentOS
4. Fedora
5. Arch`
