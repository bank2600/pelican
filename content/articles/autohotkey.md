Summary: Changing windows keyboard bindings.  

I have switched from Sublimetext to Vim. Remapping keys in Windows is a bitch. I had to use a program named auto hot key. I was using something called uncap but it quit working. I did not really troubleshoot the issue I just looked for something else.

**Update** 

As of 4/9/2016 Autohotkey quit working I have switched to another software for remapping keys on Windows. Now I'm using something called sharpkeys. It just writes the rebinds to the registery. The thought of that kinda makes me cringe.
