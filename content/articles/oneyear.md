Summary: One year gone
Cover: ./3wheel.jpg
 
One year has passed since you have been gone. I am still pissed off and confused why you left so soon? Change date. I had planned on visiting you today. A friend asked for some help around the house here in town. She is pretty cool for a white girl. It was good to keep my mind busy and focus on something else. I will still come visit for sure don't worry. We talked about suicide being the easy way of giving up before, yet you still did it?
