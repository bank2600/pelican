Summary: Player 2 down

Just got the news a childhood buddy took his own life over the weekend. He was a total badass. I'm angry and sad at the same time. Still trying to process this. We caught a lot of fish together. I guess writing about this confirms this as real. You never know what someone is dealing with if they keep silent. Yep
