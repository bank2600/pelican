Summary: Distrohopping 

Over the past year the distros I've ran on my laptop have been a path of.

1. Ubuntu - Unity crashed as much *OR* more then Windows.
2. Arch - I messed this install up and figured I'd try something new to replace it. I still have the backups if I need to go back.
3. Fedora - I could not get Fedora to suspend to disk. Great system just would not suspend.
4. OpenSuse Tumbleweed - I have managed to get everything working as expected mostly. The only issues that I seem to be having are getting networking working in KVM using the frontend virt-manager. 

*Update 4/18/2016*
I figured out the networking issue. I had the KVM guest on it's own isolated network. Once I setup the the ip range on a 10.0.0.0 network and dns everything worked fine!
